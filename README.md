# Exercise 01a: Install Software

## My name is:
Kevin Hosek

## My gamedev.stackexchange.com user number is:
166687

## My github username is:
khosek

## My replit username is:
KevinHosek1

## I have installed the software on my computer as a part of the exercise
I'm having difficulty installing Twine; pressing the download button on the website directs me 
to the GitHub page, and the instructions on the GitHub page direct me back to the website. The 
browser version appears to run fine, so for now I will try using that.
